stored procedures will write the sql query once and use them again and again we no need to write the code again and again in it self it says storing of the procedure 

Syntax :
// Creation of the Stored Procedure 
create procedure procedure name 
AS
BEGIN 
-----lines of code -----
-----lines of code -----
-----lines of code -----
END

//  Alter 
Alter procedure procedure name 
AS
BEGIN 
-----lines of code -----
-----lines of code -----
-----lines of code -----
END

// TO run or execute 
exec procedure name 
        or 
execute   procedure name 

// Using parameters - in parameters we use @ symbole before AS 
create procedure procedure name 
@ empid
@product name 
AS
BEGIN 
-----lines of code -----
-----lines of code -----
-----lines of code -----
END
select * from emp where productname = @productname;
select * from  emp where empid =@empid;



//drop of stored procedure 
create procedure procedure name 
AS
BEGIN 
-----lines of code -----
-----lines of code -----
-----lines of code -----
END

drop table emp;  // we use only DDl commands drop we wont use delete command 


helptext in stored procedure uses the  below syntax as predefined 
sp_helptext -- it usually returns the text procedure code that where we have written  it mainly focuses on _ underscore .

EXAMPLE :


create table employe
(
EmployeeID   int,
EmployeeName varchar(20),
Salary int,
Department varchar(20)
);

insert into employe(EmployeeID,EmployeeName,Salary,Department) values (1,'ram',34600,'mech');
insert into employe(EmployeeID,EmployeeName,Salary,Department) values (2,'raju',56600,'civil');
insert into employe(EmployeeID,EmployeeName,Salary,Department) values (3,'ramesh',12500,'it');
insert into employe(EmployeeID,EmployeeName,Salary,Department) values (4,'rakesh',64600,'mech');
insert into employe(EmployeeID,EmployeeName,Salary,Department) values (5,'rani',45900,'mech');
insert into employe(EmployeeID,EmployeeName,Salary,Department) values (6,'rahul',43600,'it');
insert into employe(EmployeeID,EmployeeName,Salary,Department) values (7,'ramaya',89600,'mech');
insert into employe(EmployeeID,EmployeeName,Salary,Department) values (8,'rathod',50600,'csd');
insert into employe(EmployeeID,EmployeeName,Salary,Department) values (9,'ramya',33600,'mech');
insert into employe(EmployeeID,EmployeeName,Salary,Department) values (10,'ramani',21600,'csd');

select * from employe;


-- stored procedures --
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeDetails
 @Department varchar(20)
AS
BEGIN 
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employe WHERE Department = @Department)
    BEGIN 
        SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Salary 
        FROM employe 
        WHERE Department = @Department;
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN 
        PRINT 'No employees found in this department.';
    END 
END;
GO

-- Execute procedure with parameter
EXEC GetEmployeDetails @Department = 'mech';
EXEC GetEmployeDetails @Department = '';
