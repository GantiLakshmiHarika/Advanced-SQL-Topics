stored procedures will write the sql query once and use them again and again we no need to write the code again and again in it self it says storing of the procedure 

Syntax :
// Creation of the Stored Procedure 
create procedure procedure name 
AS
BEGIN 
-----lines of code -----
-----lines of code -----
-----lines of code -----
END

//  Alter 
Alter procedure procedure name 
AS
BEGIN 
-----lines of code -----
-----lines of code -----
-----lines of code -----
END

// TO run or execute 
exec procedure name 
        or 
execute   procedure name 

// Using parameters - in parameters we use @ symbole before AS 
create procedure procedure name 
@ empid
@product name 
AS
BEGIN 
-----lines of code -----
-----lines of code -----
-----lines of code -----
END
select * from emp where productname = @productname;
select * from  emp where empid =@empid;



//drop of stored procedure 
create procedure procedure name 
AS
BEGIN 
-----lines of code -----
-----lines of code -----
-----lines of code -----
END

drop table emp;  // we use only DDl commands drop we wont use delete command 


helptext in stored procedure uses the  below syntax as predefined
