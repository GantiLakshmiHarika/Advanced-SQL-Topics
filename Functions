Function in SQL?
A function is like a little program in the database that:
Takes input (like a number or name).
Does some calculation or operation.
Returns a value (like a number, text, or even a table).
Key point: A function must return something

Types of Functions
1Ô∏è‚É£ Scalar Function
Returns only one value.
Example: You have a salary, and you want to calculate 10% bonus.
2Ô∏è‚É£ How to Create a Scalar Function
CREATE FUNCTION GetBonus (@Salary INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
    RETURN (@Salary * 0.1)
END;
3Ô∏è‚É£ How to Execute a Scalar Function
SELECT EmployeeName, dbo.GetBonus(Salary) AS Bonus
FROM employe;


1Ô∏è‚É£ Table-Valued Function
Returns a table (like a normal query result).
Example: Get all employees of a specific department.

just give me a task on stored procedures
ChatGPT said:
Here‚Äôs a simple task on Stored Procedures for you:

üëâ Task:
Create a stored procedure named GetEmployeeDetails that takes an employee department name (@DeptName) as input and returns:

Employee ID

Employee Name

Salary

Department

from an Employees table.

Also, if no employees exist for that department, return a message saying "No employees found in this department."

Do you want me to also write the SQL code for this task, or do you want to try it yourself first?

You said:
yes 
ChatGPT said:
Here‚Äôs the SQL code for the task I gave you:

-- Create Employees table (if not already created)
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmpName VARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    DeptName VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert some sample data
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES 
(1, 'Harika', 3500, 'IT'),
(2, 'Chandana', 4000, 'DataScience'),
(3, 'Lakshmi', 3000, 'IT'),
(4, 'Anusha', 4500, 'HR'),
(5, 'Kiran', 5000, 'Finance');

-- Create Stored Procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails
    @DeptName VARCHAR(50)
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;

    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Employees WHERE DeptName = @DeptName)
    BEGIN
        SELECT EmpID, EmpName, Salary, DeptName
        FROM Employees
        WHERE DeptName = @DeptName;
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'No employees found in this department.';
    END
END;
GO

-- Execute the procedure (example)
EXEC GetEmployeeDetails @DeptName = 'IT';
EXEC GetEmployeeDetails @DeptName = 'Marketing';
‚úÖ First execution (IT) ‚Üí will return employees in IT.
‚úÖ Second execution (Marketing) ‚Üí will print "No employees found in this department."

Do you want me to make the procedure return the message as a result set (like a table output) instead of just printing it?

You said:

(
EmployeeID   int,
EmployeeName varchar(20),
Salary int,
Department varchar(20)

 AS
 BEGIN 
 select EmployeeID,EmployeeName,Salary from emp where Department =@Department;
 End

 else
 
 Begin 
 PRINT 'No employees found in this department.';
 end 

 execute GetEmployeDetails;
ChatGPT said:
I see the issue üëç.
There are a couple of mistakes in your code:

In your procedure, you used the table name emp, but your table name is actually employe.

You cannot put an ELSE directly after a SELECT. You must first use an IF EXISTS.

While executing the procedure, you must pass the parameter value.

Here‚Äôs the corrected stored procedure code:

-- Stored Procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeDetails
    @Department VARCHAR(20)
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;

    -- Check if employees exist in given department
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employe WHERE Department = @Department)
    BEGIN
        SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Salary
        FROM employe
        WHERE Department = @Department;
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'No employees found in this department.';
    END
END;
GO

-- Execute the procedure
EXEC GetEmployeDetails @Department = 'mech';
EXEC GetEmployeDetails @Department = 'civil';
EXEC GetEmployeDetails @Department = 'ece';  -- This will print the message
‚úÖ Now it will:

Show results for departments like 'mech' or 'civil'.

Print "No employees found in this department." if you pass a department that doesn‚Äôt exist.

Do you want me to also modify it so that instead of just PRINT, it returns the message as a result set (table row)?

You said:
no is there any issues in my code just correct my code no need new code 
ChatGPT said:
Got it üëç you just want your same code corrected.
Here‚Äôs your code with minimum corrections:

-- stored procedures --
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeDetails
 @Department varchar(20)
AS
BEGIN 
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employe WHERE Department = @Department)
    BEGIN 
        SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Salary 
        FROM employe 
        WHERE Department = @Department;
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN 
        PRINT 'No employees found in this department.';
    END 
END;
GO

-- Execute procedure with parameter
EXEC GetEmployeDetails @Department = 'mech';
‚úÖ Fixes I did in your code:

Changed table name emp ‚Üí employe.

Wrapped your SELECT inside an IF EXISTS (because ELSE can‚Äôt directly follow a SELECT).

Added proper parameter while executing.

Would you like me to also make it work without needing to check IF EXISTS, so that the SELECT just returns an empty result set when no employees are found?

You said:
i have write any if condition 
i had not  write any if condition 
ChatGPT said:
Yes üëç you are right ‚Äî in the code you wrote, there was no IF condition, but you directly used ELSE after the SELECT.
That‚Äôs why it was giving an error.

üëâ In SQL, you cannot write:

SELECT ... 
ELSE 
PRINT 'message';
ELSE only works with IF or inside control flow blocks.

So if you really don‚Äôt want to write IF, then your stored procedure should simply be:

CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeDetails
 @Department VARCHAR(20)
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Salary
    FROM employe
    WHERE Department = @Department;
END;
GO

-- Execute
EXEC GetEmployeDetails @Department = 'mech';
EXEC GetEmployeDetails @Department = 'ece';  -- will just return empty result set
‚ö°Here:

If data exists ‚Üí it will show employees.

If no data exists ‚Üí it will just return 0 rows, no error, no message.

üëâ So in short:

If you want ELSE with PRINT, you must use IF.

If you don‚Äôt want IF, then keep only the SELECT.

Do you want me to make your version work without IF but still show a message row like ‚ÄúNo employees found‚Äù instead of just empty results?

You said:
in if condition can we right like this also IF EXISTS () 
    BEGIN 
        SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Salary 
        FROM employe 
        WHERE Department = @Department;
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN 
        PRINT 'No employees found in this department.';
    END 
ChatGPT said:
‚úÖ Yes, exactly!
That‚Äôs the correct syntax if you want to use ELSE.

Here‚Äôs the clean version of what you wrote (works perfectly in SQL Server):

CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeDetails
 @Department VARCHAR(20)
AS
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employe WHERE Department = @Department)
    BEGIN
        SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Salary 
        FROM employe 
        WHERE Department = @Department;
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN 
        PRINT 'No employees found in this department.';
    END
END;
GO

-- Example execution
EXEC GetEmployeDetails @Department = 'mech';  -- returns employees
EXEC GetEmployeDetails @Department = 'ece';   -- prints message
So yes üëå IF EXISTS (...) BEGIN ... END ELSE BEGIN ... END is the right way to handle this.

Do you also want me to show how to return the message as a result row (like a table output) instead of PRINT?

You said:
no in if condition () if we not write any thing also execute ha
ChatGPT said:
Ah I get what you‚Äôre asking üëç

In T-SQL, the IF condition must have a Boolean expression inside the parentheses.
You cannot leave it empty like this:

IF ()
BEGIN
   ...
END
‚ùå This will throw a syntax error.

‚úÖ Correct forms are like:

IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employe WHERE Department = @Department)
BEGIN
    ...
END
or

IF @Department = 'mech'
BEGIN
   ...
END
So to answer your question clearly:
üëâ No, you cannot leave IF () empty. Something must be inside the brackets that evaluates to TRUE or FALSE.

Do you want me to show you a few different valid IF condition examples with your employe table?

You said:
ok done 
ChatGPT said:
Great üëç glad it‚Äôs clear now! üéâ

Would you like me to give you one more small task on stored procedures (a bit different, like using input & output parameters), so you can practice more?

You said:
till stored procedure done next ?
ChatGPT said:
Perfect üëå if you‚Äôve completed Stored Procedures, the next topics in Advanced SQL usually come in this order:

Functions (User-Defined Functions - UDFs)

Scalar Functions (return single value)

Table-Valued Functions (return a table)

Triggers

AFTER Triggers (fire after INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

INSTEAD OF Triggers (replace the action)

Views

Simple Views

Indexed Views

Transactions

BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

Indexes

Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index

Unique Index

üëâ So your next topic after Stored Procedures is Functions (UDFs).

Do you want me to directly give you a task on Functions (like we did for procedures) so you can practice hands-on?

You said:
no i havent learn about functions yet 
ChatGPT said:
Ah, got it üëç

Since you haven‚Äôt learned Functions yet, we‚Äôll keep it in order.

Next topic after Stored Procedures is usually Triggers.

Triggers are special procedures that automatically execute when certain actions happen on a table (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

I can give you a simple task on Triggers so you can start practicing once you‚Äôre ready.

Do you want me to give that task?

You said:
give about functions 
ChatGPT said:
Great! Let‚Äôs talk about Functions in SQL.

What are Functions?
A function is a database object that performs a calculation or operation and returns a value.
Unlike Stored Procedures, functions must return a value and can be used inside queries (like in SELECT, WHERE, etc.).

Types of Functions
Scalar Function

Returns a single value.

Example: Calculate bonus for an employee.

CREATE FUNCTION GetBonus (@Salary INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
    RETURN (@Salary * 10 / 100)
END;

-- Usage
SELECT EmployeeName, dbo.GetBonus(Salary) AS Bonus
FROM employe;
Table-Valued Function (TVF)

Returns a table.

Example: Return all employees from a specific department.

CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeesByDept (@Dept VARCHAR(20))
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
(
    SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Salary
    FROM employe
    WHERE Department = @Dept
);

-- Usage
SELECT * FROM dbo.GetEmployeesByDept('mech');
Key Differences Between Stored Procedures & Functions
Feature	Stored Procedure	Function
Returns	0 or more result sets	Must return a value (scalar or table)
Can be used in SELECT?	No	Yes
Can modify data?	Yes	Usually No (scalar), Table function can read data
If you want, I can give you a small practice task for Functions (like the Stored Procedure task you did) so you can try writing one yourself.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
i am begineer so tell clearly one by one 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect! Let‚Äôs go step by step and make it very easy to understand.

Step 1: What is a Function in SQL?
A function is like a little program in the database that:

Takes input (like a number or name).

Does some calculation or operation.

Returns a value (like a number, text, or even a table).

Key point: A function must return something, unlike a stored procedure which may or may not return.

Step 2: Types of Functions
1Ô∏è‚É£ Scalar Function
Returns only one value.

Example: You have a salary, and you want to calculate 10% bonus.

CREATE FUNCTION GetBonus (@Salary INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
    RETURN (@Salary * 10 / 100)
END;
How to use it:

SELECT EmployeeName, dbo.GetBonus(Salary) AS Bonus
FROM employe;
Here dbo.GetBonus(Salary) calculates 10% of each employee‚Äôs salary.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Table-Valued Function
Returns a table (like a normal query result).

Example: Get all employees of a specific department.

CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeesByDept (@Dept VARCHAR(20))
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
(
    SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Salary
    FROM employe
    WHERE Department = @Dept
);
How to use it:

SELECT * FROM dbo.GetEmployeesByDept('mech');
This will return all employees from the mech department.

Step 3: Difference Between Stored Procedures and Functions
Feature	Stored Procedure	Function
Returns	Optional	Must return a value
Can be used in SELECT?	No	Yes
Can modify data?	Yes	Usually No
Execution	EXEC ProcedureName	Use in SELECT or EXEC Table Function
If you want, I can now give you a very simple task to create your first scalar function so you can practice.

Do you want me to do that next?

You said:
dbo.GetBonus(Salary) why we should only use in this format 
ChatGPT said:
Ah, good question! Let me explain clearly.

Why we write dbo.GetBonus(Salary) instead of just GetBonus(Salary)
dbo is the schema name

Every table, procedure, or function in SQL Server belongs to a schema.

By default, most objects are in the dbo schema.

Writing dbo. tells SQL Server exactly which schema the function belongs to.

It avoids confusion

If there are multiple schemas with a function named GetBonus, SQL Server knows which one to use.

Example:

HR.GetBonus ‚Üí function in HR schema

Finance.GetBonus ‚Üí function in Finance schema

SQL Server recommends using schema

Even if there‚Äôs only one function, using the schema makes queries faster and safer.

‚úÖ In short:
dbo.GetBonus(Salary) = clear, exact, safe.

GetBonus(Salary) = works too if there‚Äôs no ambiguity, but not recommended for production.

If you want, I can also show an example where not using dbo can cause an error so you‚Äôll see why it‚Äôs safer.

Do you want me to show that?

You said:
explain about scalr function i dont understand how to execute it 
ChatGPT said:
No worries! Let‚Äôs go very step by step so you clearly understand Scalar Functions and how to use them.

1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Scalar Function?
A Scalar Function is a function that:

Takes input parameters (optional, can be 0 or more).

Does some calculation or operation.

Returns only one value (a single number, text, or date).

Example: Calculate 10% of an employee‚Äôs salary as a bonus.

2Ô∏è‚É£ How to Create a Scalar Function
CREATE FUNCTION GetBonus (@Salary INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
    RETURN (@Salary * 10 / 100)
END;
Explanation:

CREATE FUNCTION GetBonus (@Salary INT) ‚Üí Creates a function named GetBonus that takes 1 input: Salary.

RETURNS INT ‚Üí The function will return an integer value.

RETURN (@Salary * 10 / 100) ‚Üí The calculation: 10% of the salary.

3Ô∏è‚É£ How to Execute a Scalar Function
Unlike a stored procedure, you cannot just use EXEC.

You use it inside a query, like:

SELECT EmployeeName, dbo.GetBonus(Salary) AS Bonus
FROM employe;
Explanation:

dbo.GetBonus(Salary) ‚Üí calls the function for each row in the table.

AS Bonus ‚Üí names the column in the result.

‚úÖ Output will look like:

EmployeeName	Bonus
ram	3460
raju	5660
ramesh	1250
4Ô∏è‚É£ You can also use it with variables
DECLARE @mySalary INT = 50000;
SELECT dbo.GetBonus(@mySalary) AS MyBonus;
Here, @mySalary = 50000

dbo.GetBonus(@mySalary) ‚Üí returns 5000

Key Points
Scalar functions return only one value per call.

They cannot change data in tables (unlike procedures).

Always use schema name (dbo.GetBonus) for safety.

If you want, I can give you a very simple task to create your first scalar function and try executing it yourself.

Do you want me to give that task now?

You said:
i dont understand about scalar function so explain easily and how to execute it 
ChatGPT said:
Got it! Let‚Äôs make Scalar Functions super easy to understand, step by step.

1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Scalar Function?
Think of it like a calculator in SQL:

You give it some input ‚Üí it does a calculation ‚Üí it gives you one result.

Always returns only one value (number, text, date, etc.).

Example in real life:

You have a salary of 50000.

You want to calculate 10% bonus.

Scalar Function does this and returns 5000.

2Ô∏è‚É£ How to Create a Scalar Function
CREATE FUNCTION GetBonus (@Salary INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
    RETURN (@Salary * 10 / 100)
END;
Explanation:

GetBonus ‚Üí Name of the function.

@Salary INT ‚Üí Input value (salary).

RETURNS INT ‚Üí The function will give one number as output.

RETURN (@Salary * 10 / 100) ‚Üí The calculation inside the function.

3Ô∏è‚É£ How to Use / Execute It
Unlike stored procedures, you don‚Äôt use EXEC.

You use it in a SELECT query like this:

SELECT EmployeeName, dbo.GetBonus(Salary) AS Bonus
FROM employe;
‚úÖ What happens here:

For each employee in the table, SQL calls GetBonus(Salary).

Calculates 10% of their salary.

Shows the result in a column called Bonus.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Using it with a Variable
DECLARE @mySalary INT = 50000;
SELECT dbo.GetBonus(@mySalary) AS MyBonus;
Input = 50000

Output = 5000

Key Points
Scalar functions return one value.

Can be used in SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY.

Cannot modify data in tables (just calculates).

Always call it with schema name: dbo.FunctionName.

If you want, I can now give you a very simple task to practice your first Scalar Function so you can try it yourself and see how it works.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
Create function GetBonus(@salary)
Returns int
AS
Begin 
--salary increased by 10%--
return (salary*0.1/100)
end;
ChatGPT said:
Ah! I see what you wrote. There are a couple of small issues in your function. Let me correct it step by step.

Correct Scalar Function
CREATE FUNCTION GetBonus(@Salary INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
    -- Salary increased by 10% --
    RETURN (@Salary * 10 / 100);  -- 10% of salary
END;
GO
What was wrong in your version
You wrote @salary in parameter ‚Üí correct. But inside the function, you wrote salary (without @).

In SQL, always use @ to refer to parameter names.

Calculation: salary*0.1/100

This actually gives a very tiny number.

To calculate 10%, use @Salary * 10 / 100 or @Salary * 0.1.

How to Execute / Use It
-- Using table data
SELECT EmployeeName, dbo.GetBonus(Salary) AS Bonus
FROM employe;

-- Using a single value
DECLARE @mySalary INT = 50000;
SELECT dbo.GetBonus(@mySalary) AS MyBonus;
‚úÖ This will correctly return 10% of the salary.

If you want, I can make a tiny diagram showing how input goes into the function and output comes out ‚Äî makes it super easy to visualize.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
Create function GetBonus(@salary)
Returns int
AS
Begin 
--salary increased by 10%--
return (@salary*0.1/100)
end;
select dbo.GetBonous(@salary) AS Bonus
FROM employe;
ChatGPT said:
Ah, I see a few issues in your code. Let me correct them clearly for you.

Corrected Function
CREATE FUNCTION GetBonus(@salary INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN 
    -- Salary increased by 10% --
    RETURN (@salary * 10 / 100);  -- Correct 10% calculation
END;
GO
How to Use / Execute It
SELECT EmployeeName, dbo.GetBonus(Salary) AS Bonus
FROM employe;
Mistakes in your version
You wrote @salary*0.1/100 ‚Üí This gives 0.0001 of salary, not 10%.

Correct formula: @salary * 10 / 100 or @salary * 0.1

You wrote dbo.GetBonous ‚Üí Spelling is wrong. Correct function name is dbo.GetBonus.

@salary in SELECT dbo.GetBonus(@salary) ‚Üí You don‚Äôt use the variable here. You use column name from table, like Salary.

‚úÖ So the working version is exactly:

CREATE FUNCTION GetBonus(@salary INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN 
    RETURN (@salary * 10 / 100);
END;
GO

SELECT EmployeeName, dbo.GetBonus(Salary) AS Bonus
FROM employe;
This will return 10% bonus for each employee correctly.

If you want, I can also show a super simple version that works even if you have decimal salaries. It will avoid rounding errors.

Do you want me to show that?

You said:
Create function GetBonus(@salary)
Returns int
AS
Begin 
--salary increased by 10%--
return (@salary*0.1)
end;
select dbo.GetBonus(salary) AS Bonus
FROM employe;
ChatGPT said:
Yes! ‚úÖ This version is almost correct and will work for calculating 10% of salary.

Your Corrected Scalar Function
CREATE FUNCTION GetBonus(@salary INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN 
    -- Calculate 10% of salary --
    RETURN (@salary * 0.1);
END;
GO
How to Use / Execute It
SELECT EmployeeName, dbo.GetBonus(Salary) AS Bonus
FROM employe;
Notes
Using 0.1 is fine and gives 10%.

The return type is INT, so if the result is decimal (like 34600 √ó 0.1 = 3460), SQL will truncate any decimal part.

If you want exact decimal values, use RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2) instead of INT:

CREATE FUNCTION GetBonus(@salary INT)
RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2)
AS
BEGIN 
    RETURN (@salary * 0.1);
END;
GO
Then your SELECT will give decimal bonus like 3460.00.

If you want, I can give a small practice task so you can try creating your own scalar function for learning.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
CREATE FUNCTION GetBonus(@salary INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN 
    -- Calculate 10% of salary --
    RETURN (@salary * 0.1);
END;
GO
--salary increased by 10%--
return (@salary*0.1)
end;
SELECT EmployeeName, dbo.GetBonus(Salary) AS Bonus
FROM employe;  all in one code 
ChatGPT said:
Ah, I see! You‚Äôre trying to write everything together, but there are some mistakes in your combined code. You cannot write RETURN outside the function. Everything inside the function must be between BEGIN ... END.

Here‚Äôs the correct ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù code:

-- Create the scalar function
CREATE FUNCTION GetBonus(@salary INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN 
    -- Calculate 10% of salary
    RETURN (@salary * 0.1);
END;
GO

-- Use the function to get bonus for each employee
SELECT EmployeeName, dbo.GetBonus(Salary) AS Bonus
FROM employe;
‚úÖ Notes:

The second RETURN (@salary*0.1) and END; you wrote outside the function should be removed.

Everything you want the function to do must be inside the first BEGIN ‚Ä¶ END.

After creating the function, you just call it in SELECT like dbo.GetBonus(Salary).

If you want, I can make a diagram showing how the salary goes into the function and bonus comes out, which makes scalar functions super easy to understand.

Do you want me to do that?

ChatGPT said:
Ah! These errors are common in SQL Server when you try to run multiple CREATE statements together without separating batches. Let me explain each error and how to fix it.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Error:
'CREATE/ALTER PROCEDURE' must be the first statement in a query batch.
Reason:

In SQL Server, CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE FUNCTION must start a new batch.

If you have other statements before it (like SELECT or DECLARE), SQL Server will throw this error.

Fix:

Use GO before creating the procedure/function to start a new batch.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Error:
'CREATE FUNCTION' must be the first statement in a query batch.
Reason:

Same as above. CREATE FUNCTION must start a batch.

Fix:

Add GO before the CREATE FUNCTION statement.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Error:
Must declare the scalar variable "@salary".
Reason:

You used @salary outside the function, like return (@salary*0.1) or in a SELECT.

SQL Server doesn‚Äôt know @salary unless it‚Äôs a column or variable.

Fix:

When calling the function, use a table column like Salary:

SELECT EmployeeName, dbo.GetBonus(Salary) AS Bonus
FROM employe;
Or if using a variable:

DECLARE @salary INT = 50000;
SELECT dbo.GetBonus(@salary) AS Bonus;
‚úÖ Correct Way to Write All in One Script
-- If there was any previous code, separate batches with GO
GO

-- Create the scalar function
CREATE FUNCTION GetBonus(@salary INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN 
    RETURN (@salary * 0.1);
END;
GO  -- End of batch for CREATE FUNCTION

-- Use the function with table column
SELECT EmployeeName, dbo.GetBonus(Salary) AS Bonus
FROM employe;
GO

-- Or use it with a variable
DECLARE @salary INT = 50000;
SELECT dbo.GetBonus(@salary) AS Bonus;
GO
If you want, I can rewrite your Stored Procedure and Scalar Function code together in one file so it runs without any errors in SQL Server.
